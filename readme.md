# [GraphQL Application](https://github/profmcdan/graphql-learn)
In this tutorial, you learned how to build a GraphQL server from scratch. The stack you used was based on Node.js, graphql-yoga and Prisma.

graphql-yoga is a fast and simple GraphQL server library built on top of Express.js. It comes with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for GraphQL Playgrounds and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.

The Yoga server is consuming a database layer that’s provided by Prisma. The connection between Prisma and the Yoga server is implemented via Prisma bindings.

You also learned how to leverage additional tools to improve your development workflows, such as graphql-config or the GraphQL CLI.
